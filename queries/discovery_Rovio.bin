A + 'Fire Emblem Heroes' most profitable Nintendo/DeNA mobile game, 'Angry Birds Champions' tournaments have cash prizes By Roger Fingas Wednesday, February 21, 2018, 08:43 am PT (11:43 am ET) The most successful Nintendo/DeNA smartphone game so far has been \"Fire Emblem Heroes,\" pulling in about $295 million worldwide in its first year, according to recent data. But, competitor Rovio might challenge that with the new \"Angry Birds Champions\" which allows users to win cash prizes in online tournaments. By comparison, \"Super Mario Run\" generated about $56 million in the same timespan, said research firm SensorTower. The key difference is likely in in-app transaction models —whereas the only cost in \"Mario\" is a one-time fee to unlock all levels, \"Fire Emblem Heroes\" is a so-called \"free-to-play\" game in which players can repeatedly buy in-game currency.
