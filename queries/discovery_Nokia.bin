Iraq — From their outpost on Iraq's westernmost edge, U.S. 1st Lt. Kyle Hagerty and his troops watched civilians trickle into the area after American and Iraqi forces drove out the Islamic State group. They were, he believed, families returning to liberated homes, a hopeful sign of increasing stability. But when he interviewed them on a recent reconnaissance patrol, he discovered he was wrong. They were families looking for shelter after being driven from their homes in a nearby town. Those who pushed them out were forces from among their \"liberators\" — Shiite militiamen who seized control of the area after defeating the IS militants. It was a bitter sign of the mixed legacy from the United States' intervention in Iraq to help defeat the militants. American-backed military firepower brought down the IS \"caliphate,\" but many of the divisions and problems that helped fuel the extremists' rise remain unresolved.","main_image_url":"http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1518819169","country":"US","source_type":"mainstream","language":"en","publication_date":"2018-02-18T00:45:00Z","enriched_text":{"entities":[{"count":23,"sentiment":{"score":0.0305669,"label":"positive"},"text":"Iraq","relevance":0.843025,"type":"Location","disambiguation":{"subtype":["GovernmentalJurisdiction","MilitaryPost","CityTown","Country"],"name":"Iraq","dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq"}},{"count":20,"sentiment":{"score":-0.193892,"label":"negative"},"text":"United States","relevance":0.455485,"type":"Location","disambiguation":{"subtype":["Region","AdministrativeDivision","GovernmentalJurisdiction","FilmEditor","Country"],"name":"United States","dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States"}},{"count":2,"sentiment":{"score":0,"label":"neutral"},"text":"Iraqi army","relevance":0.296603,"type":"Organization","disambiguation":{"subtype":["ArmedForce"],"name":"Iraqi Army","dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraqi_Army"}},{"count":6,"sentiment":{"score":0,"label":"neutral"},"text":"QAIM","relevance":0.282457,"type":"Location","disambiguation":{"subtype":["City"]}},{"count":5,"sentiment":{"score":-0.427116,"label":"negative"},"text":"Lt.

Kyle Hagerty and his troops watched civilians trickle into the area after American and Iraqi forces drove out the Islamic State group. They were, he believed, families returning to liberated homes, a hopeful sign of increasing stability. But when he interviewed them on a recent reconnaissance patrol, he discovered he was wrong. They were families looking for shelter after being driven from their homes in a nearby town. Those who pushed them out were forces from among their “liberators” — Shiite militiamen who seized control of the area after defeating the IS militants. It was a bitter sign of the mixed legacy from the United States’ intervention in Iraq to help defeat the militants. American-backed military firepower brought down the IS “caliphate,” but many of the divisions and problems that helped fuel the extremists’ rise remain unresolved.","main_image_url":"http://www.news1130.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2018/02/17/IRQSG506-125_2018_110527_hd.jpg","country":"CA","source_type":"mainstream","language":"en","publication_date":"2018-02-17T22:22:00-06:00","enriched_text":{"entities":[{"count":21,"sentiment":{"score":-0.0307496,"label":"negative"},"text":"Iraq","relevance":0.842098,"type":"Location","disambiguation":{"subtype":["GovernmentalJurisdiction","MilitaryPost","CityTown","Country"],"name":"Iraq","dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraq"}},{"count":20,"sentiment":{"score":-0.21757,"label":"negative"},"text":"United States","relevance":0.464463,"type":"Location","disambiguation":{"subtype":["Region","AdministrativeDivision","GovernmentalJurisdiction","FilmEditor","Country"],"name":"United States","dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States"}},{"count":6,"sentiment":{"score":0,"label":"neutral"},"text":"QAIM","relevance":0.31704,"type":"Location","disambiguation":{"subtype":["City"]}},{"count":2,"sentiment":{"score":0,"label":"neutral"},"text":"Iraqi army","relevance":0.298102,"type":"Organization","disambiguation":{"subtype":["ArmedForce"],"name":"Iraqi Army","dbpedia_resource":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iraqi_Army"}},{"count":1,"sentiment":{"score":0,"label":"neutral"},"text":"Iraq","relevance":0.264297,"type":"Location","disambiguation":{"subtype":["StateOrCounty"]}},{"count":6,"sentiment":{"score":0.200819,"label":"positive"},"text":"Lt.
